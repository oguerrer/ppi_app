    """Function to run one simulation of the Policy Priority Inference model.

    Parameters
    ----------
        I0: numpy array 
            Vector with initial values of the development indicators.
        alphas: numpy array
            Vector with parameters representing the size of a positive change 
            in the indicators.
        alphas_prime: numpy array
            Vector with parameters representing the size of a negative change 
            in the indicators.
        betas: numpy array
            Vector with parameters that normalize the contribution of public 
            expenditure and spillovers to the probability of a positive change
            in the indicators.
        A:  2D numpy array (optional)
            The adjacency matrix of the spillover network of development 
            indicators. The rows denote the origins of spillovers and the columns
            their destinations. Self-loops are not allowed, so PPI turns A's
            diagonal into zeros. If not provided, the default value is a matrix 
            full of zeros.
        R:  numpy array (optional)
            Vector that specifies whether an indicator is instrumental
            or collateral. Instrumental indicators have value 1 and collateral
            ones have zero. If not provided, the default value is
            a vector of ones.
        bs: numpy array (optional)
            Vector with modulating factors for the budgetary allocation of
            each instrumental indicator. Its size should be equal to the number
            of instrumental indicators. If not provided, the default value is
            a vector of ones.
        qm: A floating point, an integer, or a numpy array (optional)
            Vector with parametrs capturing the quality of the monitoring 
            mechanisms that procure public governance. There are three options
            to specify qm:
                - A floating: it assumes that the quality of monitoring is qm,
                that it is the same for every indicator, that it is exogenous, 
                and that it remains constant through time. In this case, qm 
                should have a value between 0 and 1.
                - An integer: it assumes that the quality of monitoring is one 
                of the indicators, so qm gives the index in I0 where this indicator
                is located. Here, the quality of monitoring is endogenous, 
                dynamic, and homogenous across the indicators.
                - A vector: it assumes that the quality of monitoring is
                heterogeneous across indicators, exogenous, and constant. Thus,
                qm has to have a size equal to the number of instrumental
                indicators. Each entry in qm denotes the quality of monitoring
                in a particular policy issue (indicator).
            If not provided, the default values is qm=0.5.
        rl: A floating point, an integer, or a numpy array (optional)
            Vector with parametrs capturing the quality of the rule of law. 
            There are three options to specify rl:
                - A floating: it assumes that the quality of the rule of law  is rl,
                that it is the same for every indicator, that it is exogenous, 
                and that it remains constant through time. In this case, rl 
                should have a value between 0 and 1.
                - An integer: it assumes that the quality of the rule of law is one 
                of the indicators, so rl gives the index in I0 where this indicator
                is located. Here, the quality of the rule of law is endogenous, 
                dynamic, and homogenous across the indicators.
                - A vector: it assumes that the quality of the rule of law is
                heterogeneous across indicators, exogenous, and constant. Thus,
                rl has to have a size equal to the number of instrumental
                indicators. Each entry in rl denotes the quality of monitoring
                in a particular policy issue (indicator).
            If not provided, the default values is rl=0.5.
        Imax: numpy array (optional)
            Vector with the theoretical upper bound of the indicators. If an entry
            contains a missing value (NaN), then there is no upper bound defined
            for that indicator and it will grow indefinitely. If not provided,
            no indicator will have upper bound.
        Imin: numpy array (optional)
            Vector with the theoretical lower bound of the indicators. If an entry
            contains a missing value (NaN), then there is no lower bound defined
            for that indicator and it will decrease indefinitely. If not provided,
            no indicator will have lower bound.
        Bs: numpy ndarray or floating point (optional)
            Disbursement schedule across expenditure programs. There are three 
            options to specify Bs:
                - A matrix: this is a disaggregated specification of the 
                disbursement schedule across expenditure programs and time. 
                The rows correspond to expenditure programs and the columns
                to simulation periods. Since there may be more or less expenditure 
                programs than indicators, the number of rows in Bs should be
                consistent with the information contained in parameter B_dict,
                otherwise PPI will throw and exception. Since the number of 
                columns denotes the number of simulation periods, parameter T
                will be overriden.
                - A vector: this would be equivalent to a matrix with a single
                row, i.e. to having a single expenditure program. This representation
                is useful when there is no information available across programs,
                but there is across time. Like in the matrix representation, 
                this input should be consistent with B_dict.
                - A floating point: this assumes there is no information about
                expenditure across programs nor time. In this case, PPI uses
                the amount provided for every simulated period, as in the case
                of the vector specification. Since here, there is no temporal 
                information about the disbursement schedule, the number of 
                simulated periods is given by parameter T.
            If not provided, the default value is Bs=100.
        B_dict: dictionary (optional)
            A dictionary that maps the indices of every indicator into the 
            expenditure program(s) designed to impact them. Since there may be
            multiple programs designed to impact and indicator, or multiple
            indicators impacted by the same program, this mapping is not 
            one to one. To account for this, B_dict has, as keys, the indices 
            of the instrumental indicators and, as values, lists containing
            the indices of the expenditure programs designed to impact them.
            The user should make sure that the keys are consistent with the 
            indices of those indicators that are instrumental. Likewise, the
            indices of the expenditure programs should be consistent with the
            number of rows in Bs, otherwise PPI will throw an exception.
            Providing B_dict is necessary if Bs is a matrix with more than one 
            row.
        G: numpy array (optional)
            The development goals to be achieved for each indicator. These are
            used only to calculate the initial development gaps, which affect 
            the allocation decision of the government agent. If not provided,
            the default initial allocations are determined randomly.
        T: int (optional)
            The maximum number of simulation periods. If Bs is provided, then T
            is overwritten by the number of columns in Bs. If not provided, the
            default value in T=50.
        frontier: numpy array (optional)
            A vector with exogenous probabilities of positive growth for each
            indicator. If an entry contains NaN, then the corresponding
            probability is endogenous. This vector is typically use to perform
            analysis with the budgetary frontier, in which the proability of 
            success of the instrumental indicators is set to 1. Alternatively,
            the 'relaxed' frontier consists of imposing a high (but less than 1)
            probability of growth. If not provided, the default behavior is that
            all the probabilities of success are endogenous. It is recommended
            to not provide this parameter unless the user understants the
            budgetary frontier frontier analysis.
